## Explanation of the directory
This directory shows all code that was used by Arend-Jan Tissing in the ADS thesis for CITO. The most important code can be found in main.py, which is where most functions that are used can be found. In the directory yolov5, the YOLO model can be found, although it was only slightly adapted for this research and taken from other sources. That directory gives a more thorough explanation of where those files come from.
