## Temporary readme 
Currently, three models are trained on the same structure of CNN. 

Code for running one of the models is available in the scripts folder. 
Code for creating the model will be added shortly. 

Currently working on a script which compares all models at the same time and visualises the results. 
Script is not added yet because the good data is not yet available.
