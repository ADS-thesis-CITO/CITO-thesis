# Automatic grading of handwritten math tests using OCR
The goal of this project is to grade handwritten math tests as accurately as possible using optical character recognition (or OCR). 

## Data
[ADD information about the used data.] 

## Output
This folder contains all the outputs of running the scripts. The folder is split between two subfolders, and their corresponding content: 

###### Images
* `modelname_architecture.jpg` 		- Images on the structure / architecture of the constructed models. 
* `training_modelname.jpg` 			- Accuracy / Loss figure of the training process for each model. 
* `(Un)Identified_number_grid.jpg`	- Grid visualizing some of the (un)identified numbers. 

###### Models 
* `modelname.json` 					- JSON file with the saved model.
* `modelname.h5`					- h5 file containing the saved weights of the model. 

## Scripts 
Additional information about the scripts can be found in the corresponding README file.
